# Privacy-Risk-Assessment-Script-for-Third-Party-APIs-
Monitor and assess the privacy risks of third-party APIs. It can analyze the API responses to identify whether any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is exposed.

### Step 1: Setup the Environment
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. curl: For making API requests.
2. jq: For parsing JSON responses.
3. grep: For searching for specific patterns in the API responses.

Installation:
On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl jq grep
```

### Step 2: Define the List of APIs and PII to Look For
Create a file called ``` apis.txt ``` that lists the APIs you want to check. Each line should contain the URL of one API.

### Step 3: Running the Script
1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x privacy_risk_assessment.sh
   ```
3. Run the script.
   ```
   ./privacy_risk_assessment.sh
   ```

## Explanation of the Script:
1. **API File**: The script reads from ```apis.txt``` to get the list of APIs to query.
2. **PII Patterns**: We define a list of common PII (e.g., emails, names, IPs) to search for in the API response.
3. **Querying the API**: The script uses ```curl``` to query each API and retrieves the JSON response.
4. **Checking for PII**: The script searches for the PII patterns using ```grep```. If PII is found, it's logged in the report file ```privacy_risk_report.txt```.
5. **Report Generation**: All the findings are written to a report file for further review.
